## 1. Unsupervised Change Detection using Satellite Images.
The idea is to capture changes in a particular areas using satellite imaginary. The changes could be a vast conflict or natural calamities. This technique could help government or relief organisations to keep an eye on various areas that are prone to such calamities so that they could provide help as soon as possible. I built this project for UNHCR and Omdena to help the people of Somalia. This project was based on a paper by Turgay Celik (link given below). You can go through the following links to know more about the project and the approach.
